component of computers:=>>

At the highest level, a computer system has five main components (according to the Von Neumann Architecture, which most modern computers follow):

üñ•Ô∏è 1. Input Unit

  What it does: Takes data and instructions from the outside world and sends them to the computer.
  Examples: Keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, touch screen.

‚öô 2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
    The ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the computer, responsible for executing instructions.The CPU itself has 3 main sub-components:

Control Unit (CU)

                Directs the flow of data between input, memory, ALU, and output.
                Acts like a ‚Äútraffic controller.‚Äù
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
                Performs mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
                Performs logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, comparisons).



  üíæ 3. Memory Unit (Storage)
                Stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently.


                Primary memory: RAM (volatile, temporary), ROM (non-volatile).
                Cache memory: Very fast, between CPU and RAM.
                Secondary memory: Hard disk, SSD, external drives (long-term storage).

 4. Output Unit
                Converts computer-processed data into human-understandable form.
                Examples: Monitor, printer, speakers, projectors.

 5. Communication/Interconnection (System Bus)

                A pathway for data transfer among CPU, memory, input, and output.

      Types of buses:

                Data Bus ‚Äì carries actual data.
                Address Bus ‚Äì carries memory addresses.
                Control Bus ‚Äì carries control signals (read/write).
