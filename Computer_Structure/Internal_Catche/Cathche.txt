Here are the different types of caches:

L1 cache:
- fastest memory for accessing the data among L1, L2, L3 caches
- as a hardware, it's placed closest to the CPU cores
- measured in KiloBytes or usually max goes up to 1MB
- approx 100x faster than your system RAM

L1 cache internally consists of two parts:
[1] Data cache: holds the data on which the operation is to be performed
[2] Instruction Cache: deals with the information about the operation that the CPU must perform
