The three main functions of a computer are:

          Data Processing (done by CPU/ALU)
          
          Data Storage (done by memory)
          
          Data Movement/Input-Output (handled by I/O devices + buses
                                                                      TRUE __ FALSE 
You said True → Correct ✅

          In Von Neumann architecture, both data and instructions share the same memory space.
          
          That’s why the CPU uses the same bus for fetching instructions and data (which sometimes causes the “Von Neumann bottleneck”).
You said No (i.e., False) → Correct ✅

Interrupts do not stop the CPU permanently.

          They just pause the current execution, handle the event with an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine), and then resume the program.
          
          You explained it nicely: interrupts make the CPU dive into handling the event and then return.
: Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle

Fetch

          CPU fetches the next instruction from main memory (RAM).
          
          The Program Counter (PC) gives the memory address.
          
          Instruction is loaded into the Instruction Register (IR).

Decode

          Control Unit decodes the opcode part of the instruction.
          
          Determines what operation is needed and which operands to use.

Execute

          The ALU (or relevant unit) performs the operation.
          
          Result is stored in a register, memory, or sent to an I/O device.

👉 Then the cycle repeats for the next instruction.

Q5. Bus System

          Name the three types of buses in a computer system and state what each carries.

ANS:==>> That’s a slick mnemonic! A C D = Address, Control, Data → easy to recall. And you’re 100% correct ✅

          Quick Recap (Q5 Final Answer):

                    A → Address Bus → carries addresses (unidirectional)
                    
                    C → Control Bus → carries control signals (read/write, interrupts, clock)
                    
                    D → Data Bus → carries actual data (bidirectional)
                    
                    And yes — “B stands for Bus” → so skip it 😅. That’s clever
