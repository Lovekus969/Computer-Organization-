The three main functions of a computer are:

          Data Processing (done by CPU/ALU)
          
          Data Storage (done by memory)
          
          Data Movement/Input-Output (handled by I/O devices + buses
You said True → Correct ✅

          In Von Neumann architecture, both data and instructions share the same memory space.
          
          That’s why the CPU uses the same bus for fetching instructions and data (which sometimes causes the “Von Neumann bottleneck”).
