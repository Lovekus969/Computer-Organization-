What is a Register in Processors/CPUs?
Registers are a type of computer memory built directly into the processor or CPU (Central Processing Unit) that is used to store and manipulate data during the execution of instructions. A register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any kind of data (such as a bit sequence or individual characters).
