What is an Embedded System?

An embedded system is a special-purpose computer that is part of a larger device and performs dedicated tasks.
Unlike a general-purpose computer (like a laptop), it is designed for specific control functions.

Examples:
            Microwave oven controller
            Car engine control unit (ECU)
            Smartwatch processor
            Washing machine controller
            ATM machine
