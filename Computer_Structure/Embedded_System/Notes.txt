What is an Embedded System?

An embedded system is a special-purpose computer that is part of a larger device and performs dedicated tasks.
Unlike a general-purpose computer (like a laptop), it is designed for specific control functions.

Examples:
            Microwave oven controller
            Car engine control unit (ECU)
            Smartwatch processor
            Washing machine controller
            ATM machine
What is the Role of embedded systems in Computer Organization? 
In Computer Organization, we study how hardware components interact with software. Embedded systems apply these principles in real-world, specialized devices.

                        Key Components of Embedded Systems:
                                                Processor (CPU / Microcontroller / DSP)
                                                The "brain" of the embedded system.
                                                Can be RISC-based (like ARM) or CISC-based (like Intel 8051).

                        Memory:=>>

                                    ROM / Flash → stores the program (firmware).
                                    RAM → temporary data storage while running.
                        Input Devices (Sensors)

                                    E.g., Temperature sensor, motion sensor, camera.
                                    Output Devices (Actuators / Displays)
                                    E.g., Motor control, LCD display, LED, buzzer.

                        I/O Interfaces

                                    Communication with external devices using UART, I²C, SPI, CAN bus, etc.
                                    Power Supply
                                    Usually low power, designed for efficiency.

                        Characteristics

                                    Dedicated Functionality → does one job well.
                                    Real-time operation → responds instantly (ex: airbags in cars).
                                    Low power consumption → optimized for efficiency.
                                    Reliability & Stability → runs continuously without failure.
                                    Small size → integrated into devices.
