Digital-to-analog converter
In electronics, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, D/A, D2A, or D-to-A) is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performs the reverse function.

DACs are commonly used in music players to convert digital data streams into analog audio signals. They are also used in televisions and mobile phones to convert digital video data into analog video signals. These two applications use DACs at opposite ends of the frequency/resolution trade-off. The audio DAC is a low-frequency, high-resolution type while the video DAC is a high-frequency low- to medium-resolution type.

Analog to Digital Conversion (A/D or ADC)
                        Definition: Converts a continuous analog signal into a digital number the processor can understand.

        Steps of ADC:  
                  Sampling â†’ Measure the analog signal at small time intervals.
                  Quantization â†’ Round the sampled values to nearest discrete level.
                  Encoding â†’ Represent that quantized level as a binary number.

        Example:
                  A temperature sensor outputs a voltage (0V â†’ 5V).
                  ADC converts it into digital values (e.g., 0â€“1023 for a 10-bit ADC). Processor reads those values and interprets temperature.

Digital to Analog Conversion (D/A or DAC)
                    Definition: Converts digital numbers (binary) from processor into a continuous analog signal.

Steps of DAC:
                  Take binary input from processor (e.g., 10101010).
                  Convert to proportional voltage/current.
                  Smooth signal using filters to remove steps (staircase effect).

Example:
              MP3 player stores music as digital data.
              DAC converts it into analog audio signals.
              Speaker plays the sound you hear.

Why Processors Need ADC & DAC

              Sensors â†’ ADC â†’ Processor â†’ DAC â†’ Actuators

ðŸ‘‰ Full Cycle Example (in a smart fan):

                Temperature sensor outputs analog voltage proportional to heat.
                ADC converts it into digital form for the processor.
                Processor decides fan speed.
                DAC converts digital speed command into an analog voltage/current.
                Fan motor runs at desired speed.

what is Actuators? 
        An actuator is a device that takes control signals from the processor (digital/analog) and produces physical action.

 Types of Actuators:

                Electrical Actuators
                        Motors (DC motor, stepper motor, servo motor),Solenoids (open/close valves, locks)

                Mechanical Actuators
                        Gears, levers, hydraulic pistons

                Thermal Actuators
                        Heating elements (electric stove, iron)

                Optical Actuators
                        Laser movement systems, projectors
 Example:
                    In a robot arm, the processor decides motion.
                    Actuators (motors) physically move the arm.
