Designing for Performance
1. What is Performance?
    Performance = how fast a computer executes programs.
  Higher performance = less time to complete a task.

Often measured by:
  Response Time (Latency): Time taken to finish one task.

Measuring Performance

Execution Time (T):

`````````````````````𝑇  =(Instruction Count) ×(CPI)× (Clock Cycle Time)
                     T=(Instruction Count)×(CPI)×(Clock Cycle Time)

            Instruction Count (IC): How many instructions a program needs.
            CPI (Cycles per Instruction): Average cycles per instruction.
            Clock Cycle Time: Inverse of clock rate (1 / frequency).

Improving Performance

To make a computer faster, you can:
			Increase Clock Rate (GHz): Faster cycles → faster CPU.
			⚠ But leads to heating and power issues.
			Reduce CPI: Optimize hardware (pipelining, parallelism, better instruction design).
			Reduce Instruction Count (IC): Compiler optimizations, efficient ISA.

4. Benchmarks
			Standard programs used to compare systems (e.g., SPEC benchmarks).Real workloads are better indicators than synthetic ones.

5. Amdahl’s Law (Important)
			The speedup gained from improving part of a system is limited by the portion not improved.

Designing for Performance (Extended Notes)
		Falling Cost, Rising Power
		The cost of computer systems keeps dropping dramatically.Meanwhile, performance and capacity rise equally dramatically.
Example:	
		A laptop today ≈ the power of an IBM mainframe from 10–15 years ago.What used to require a multi-million-dollar machine now fits in your backpack.
