The clock speed (or clock rate) is the number of cycles per second that the system clock produces to synchronize processor operations.

Measured in Hertz (Hz).

Example: A 1 GHz processor = 1 billion cycles per second.


How the Clock Works

        The clock signal is usually generated by a quartz crystal oscillator.
        The crystal produces a sine wave.
        This wave is then converted into digital pulses (0s and 1s).
        These pulses are sent continuously to the processor, synchronizing all operations.

 Each pulse = clock tick (cycle).
 The time between pulses = cycle time.
