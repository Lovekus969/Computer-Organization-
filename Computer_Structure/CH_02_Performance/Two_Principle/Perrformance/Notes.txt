The clock speed (or clock rate) is the number of cycles per second that the system clock produces to synchronize processor operations.

Measured in Hertz (Hz).

Example: A 1 GHz processor = 1 billion cycles per second.


How the Clock Works

        The clock signal is usually generated by a quartz crystal oscillator.
        The crystal produces a sine wave.
        This wave is then converted into digital pulses (0s and 1s).
        These pulses are sent continuously to the processor, synchronizing all operations.

 Each pulse = clock tick (cycle).
 The time between pulses = cycle time.

Why Clock Speed Matters ?? 
                Every operation (fetch, decode, execute, memory access) starts on a clock tick. Higher clock speed = more cycles per second → potentially faster execution.
                But ⚠ speed depends on more than just clock rate:
                                                The number of cycles per instruction (CPI).
                                                The processor design (pipeline, superscalar, cache, etc.).

The latency of signals inside the chip (distance, wiring, layout).
