fundamental principles
1. Amdahl’s Law

Amdahl’s Law tells us the maximum speedup we can get by parallelizing a task, given that some part of the task is inherently sequential.

👉 Formula:

Speedup
(𝑓,𝑁 ) =1(1−𝑓)+𝑓𝑁

Speedup(f,N)=(1−f)+Nfi/1

2. Little’s Law

Little’s Law is from queueing theory but is very important in computer systems (pipelines, I/O queues, networks).

 Formula:
															𝐿=𝜆×𝑊
L=λ×W

Where:

𝐿
L = average number of items in the system (queue length, customers, instructions in pipeline, etc.)

𝜆
λ = average arrival rate (items per unit time)

𝑊
W = average waiting time in the system

Interpretation:

If 10 requests arrive per second (λ=10) and each request spends 5 seconds in the system (W=5):


			L=10×5=50

➝ On average, 50 requests will be in the system at any time.
