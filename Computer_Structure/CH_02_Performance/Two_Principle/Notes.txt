fundamental principles
1. Amdahl’s Law

Amdahl’s Law tells us the maximum speedup we can get by parallelizing a task, given that some part of the task is inherently sequential.

👉 Formula:

Speedup
(𝑓,𝑁 ) =1(1−𝑓)+𝑓𝑁

Speedup(f,N)=(1−f)+Nfi/1

2. Little’s Law

Little’s Law is from queueing theory but is very important in computer systems (pipelines, I/O queues, networks).

 Formula:
															𝐿=𝜆×𝑊
L=λ×W
