2.1 Obstacles with higher clock speed & logic density

            As we increase clock speed (GHz) and pack more transistors per chip (logic density):
            Heat dissipation – Higher frequency = higher switching activity = more heat. Too much heat damages circuits.
            Power consumption – Power ∝ Frequency × Voltage². Faster chips need more voltage, leading to an exponential rise in energy.
            Signal propagation delay – Wires on the chip take time to send signals (speed of light limits). At very high frequencies, signals may not settle before the next clock tick.
            Synchronization issues – Multiple parts of a large chip may not stay in sync at ultra-high speeds, causing errors.
            ⚡ Insight: This is why chipmakers shifted focus from increasing frequency → to parallelism (multicore).

2.2 Advantages of cache

            Cache is fast memory close to the CPU.
            Faster memory access – L1/L2/L3 caches are orders of magnitude faster than main memory (nanoseconds vs hundreds of ns).
            Reduces average memory latency – CPU doesn’t stall as often waiting for DRAM.
            Bridges CPU–memory gap – Memory speeds haven’t scaled with CPU speeds. Cache smooths this imbalance.
            
            ⚡ Without cache, CPUs would spend most of their time idle waiting for data.

2.3 Methods to increase processor speed
            
            How designers make CPUs faster beyond just clock speed:
            Pipelining – Break instruction execution into stages (fetch, decode, execute, writeback). Multiple instructions overlap. Like an assembly line.
            Superscalar execution – Multiple instructions issued per cycle if independent (parallel execution units).
            Multicore architecture – Instead of one super-fast core, have multiple cores working in parallel.
            Speculative execution & branch prediction – CPU predicts future paths of programs and executes ahead of time. If correct, saves time; if wrong, discard.
            Larger/faster caches – Reduces stalls, improves throughput.
            ⚡ Together, these techniques improve IPC (instructions per cycle), not just raw GHz.

2.4 Obstacles at high clock speed/density
            
            Even with advanced designs:
            Power & heat issues – Thermal limits cap frequency. Cooling is expensive.
            Diminishing returns – Doubling frequency doesn’t double performance (because CPI, memory delays, etc.).
            Memory bottlenecks – CPUs get faster, but DRAM hasn’t kept up → stalls.
            Wire delays – As chips get bigger, interconnect delays dominate.
            ⚡ Moore’s Law (transistors double every ~2 years) slowed down due to these limits.
2.5 Clock rate definition

            Clock rate (clock speed) = cycles per second (Hz).
            Example: 3 GHz = 3 billion cycles per second.
            Same as frequency of CPU’s system clock
            ⚠ But → Not a full measure of performance. One 3 GHz CPU can be slower than another 2 GHz CPU if CPI is worse.
