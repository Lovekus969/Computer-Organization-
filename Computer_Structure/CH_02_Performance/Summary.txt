      Amdahl’s law → Formula that shows the limit of speedup from parallel processing.
      Arithmetic mean (AM) → Average of values (sum ÷ count).
      Base metric → A performance measure under baseline or standard conditions (e.g., SPECspeed base runs).
      Benchmark → Standardized test/program to evaluate system performance.
      
      Clock cycle / tick → One pulse of the system clock.
      Clock cycle time → Duration of one clock cycle (
                                                                          t=1/f).
      Clock rate / speed → Number of cycles per second (Hz).
      Cycles per instruction (CPI) → Average number of cycles an instruction takes.
      Functional mean (FM) → Type of average that weights values based on functionality.
      General-purpose computing on GPU (GPGPU) → Using GPUs (normally for graphics) to perform non-graphics computations.
      Geometric mean (GM) → Multiply values, take the n-th root. Used for benchmarking ratios
