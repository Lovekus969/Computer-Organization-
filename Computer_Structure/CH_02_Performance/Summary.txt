2.1 Obstacles with higher clock speed & logic density

            As we increase clock speed (GHz) and pack more transistors per chip (logic density):
            Heat dissipation – Higher frequency = higher switching activity = more heat. Too much heat damages circuits.
            Power consumption – Power ∝ Frequency × Voltage². Faster chips need more voltage, leading to an exponential rise in energy.
            Signal propagation delay – Wires on the chip take time to send signals (speed of light limits). At very high frequencies, signals may not settle before the next clock tick.
            Synchronization issues – Multiple parts of a large chip may not stay in sync at ultra-high speeds, causing errors.
            ⚡ Insight: This is why chipmakers shifted focus from increasing frequency → to parallelism (multicore).

2.2 Advantages of cache

            Cache is fast memory close to the CPU.
            Faster memory access – L1/L2/L3 caches are orders of magnitude faster than main memory (nanoseconds vs hundreds of ns).
            Reduces average memory latency – CPU doesn’t stall as often waiting for DRAM.
            Bridges CPU–memory gap – Memory speeds haven’t scaled with CPU speeds. Cache smooths this imbalance.
            
            ⚡ Without cache, CPUs would spend most of their time idle waiting for data.
