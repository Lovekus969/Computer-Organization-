Microcontroller (MCU)
A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to control specific tasks in embedded systems. It’s like a small computer on a single chip.

Key Components of a Microcontroller:
          CPU (Central Processing Unit) – the brain; executes instructions.
Memory
          ROM/Flash: Stores program code.
          RAM: Temporary storage for variables and data.
          I/O Ports (Input/Output) – connect sensors, LEDs, motors, etc.
          Timers/Counters – handle precise time-based tasks.
          ADC/DAC (Analog-to-Digital / Digital-to-Analog Converters) – interface with analog sensors or outputs.
          Communication Modules – UART, SPI, I2C for device communication.
          Clock/Reset Circuits – provide timing signals and reset functionality.

Chipset
A chipset is a collection of integrated circuits on a motherboard or system that manages data flow between the processor, memory, and peripherals.

Typical Chipset Components:
          1 Northbridge (older systems; sometimes integrated into CPU now)
                    Connects CPU ↔ RAM ↔ GPU
          2. Southbridge
                    Connects CPU ↔ I/O devices (USB, SATA, PCI, audio, network)
          3. Integrated Peripherals – Network interface, sound, storage controllers.

Explanation:
          CPU executes instructions stored in ROM/Flash.
          RAM holds temporary data.
          Timers control time-based operations.
          ADC/DAC converts signals for sensors and actuators.
          I/O ports interact with external devices.
          Communication modules handle data exchange with other devices.

EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)
Definition: EEPROM is a type of non-volatile memory that retains data even when the power is off, and it can be electrically erased and reprogrammed.
