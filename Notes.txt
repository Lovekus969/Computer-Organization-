Computer Architecture (the "what"):
Defines the functional behavior—instruction set (ISA), registers, addressing modes. It's like the blueprint or the programmer’s view.

Computer Organization (the "how"):
Defines the physical implementation—control signals, microarchitecture, how the hardware actually executes instructions.
