Computer Architecture (the "what"):
Defines the functional behavior—instruction set (ISA), registers, addressing modes. It's like the blueprint or the programmer’s view.

Computer Organization (the "how"):
Defines the physical implementation—control signals, microarchitecture, how the hardware actually executes instructions.

    ###      Basic CPU Components (Organization Level)
                    Control Unit (CU): Manages instruction flow, signals, and coordination of CPU components.
                    Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs calculations, logic, and bit-shifts.
                    Registers: Key types:
                    Accumulator – holds ALU output
                    Program Counter (PC) – stores next instruction address
                    Memory Address Register (MAR) – holds addresses for memory operations
                    Memory Data Register (MDR) – holds data sent to/from memory
                    Current Instruction Register (CIR) – stores the fetched instruction
                    (Extended: Instruction Buffer Register – holds instructions waiting to be executed)
