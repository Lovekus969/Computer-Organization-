Chapter 4 â€” The Memory Hierarchy: Locality and Performance
ðŸ”¹ 4.1 Principle of Locality

Definition:
Most programs do not access all memory locations equally. They tend to access certain areas repeatedly.
This is called the Principle of Locality â€” and it helps in designing faster memory systems.

Types of Locality:
            Temporal Locality (Time-based):
                  Recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again soon.
                  Example: A loop variable i accessed repeatedly in a for loop.
            
            Spatial Locality (Space-based):
                  Data close to recently accessed addresses are likely to be accessed soon.
                  Example: Accessing array elements sequentially (arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]).      
      
      ðŸ§© Cache memory is built to take advantage of these two kinds of locality.

4.2 Characteristics of Memory Systems
            Every memory system is described by:
