Computer Organization & Architecture â€“ What Weâ€™ve Learned So Far
1. Basic Concepts
                Computer Organization â†’ How things work internally (control signals, data paths, memory hierarchy, instruction cycles).
                Computer Architecture â†’ What is visible to the programmer (instruction set, addressing modes, system design).

ðŸ‘‰ Think of Organization = Implementation, Architecture = Design.
