Computer Organization & Architecture â€“ What Weâ€™ve Learned So Far
1. Basic Concepts
                Computer Organization â†’ How things work internally (control signals, data paths, memory hierarchy, instruction cycles).
                Computer Architecture â†’ What is visible to the programmer (instruction set, addressing modes, system design).

ðŸ‘‰ Think of Organization = Implementation, Architecture = Design.

2. CPU & Memory Hierarchy
                          Registers â†’ Fastest storage, inside CPU.
                          Cache (L1, L2, L3) â†’ Stores frequently accessed data.
                          Main Memory (RAM) â†’ Stores active programs/data.
                          Secondary Storage (HDD/SSD) â†’ Permanent storage.
                          Principle of Locality â†’ Temporal & Spatial locality â†’ why caches work.
3. Performance Factors

                          Mooreâ€™s Law â†’ More transistors in less space â†’ faster chips.
                          Problems â†’ Power consumption, heat, clock speed limits.
                          Solution â†’ Multi-core processors, pipelining, parallelism.
