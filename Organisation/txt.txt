Computer organization
Main article: Microarchitecture
Computer organization helps optimize performance-based products. For example, software engineers need to know the processing power of processors. They may need to optimize software in order to gain the most performance for the lowest price. This can require quite a detailed analysis of the computer's organization. For example, in an SD card, the designers might need to arrange the card so that the most data can be processed in the fastest possible way.


A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs, which enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.

# Computer Architecture vs Computer Organization

**Architecture** describes *what* the system does (ISA, registers, addressing modes)...  
**Organization** describes *how* it‚Äôs actually built and implemented...

- Architecture first ‚Üí then organization  
- Architecture = blueprint, Organization = implementation  
- Microarchitecture is another term for organization...


. Computer Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Refers to the abstract design and functional behavior of a computer system.

It is about what the computer does.

Defines the programmer‚Äôs view of the machine.

Examples:

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): what instructions the CPU supports (e.g., x86, ARM).


2. Computer Organization ‚öôÔ∏è

Refers to the implementation details of the architecture.

It is about how the computer does it.

Deals with the hardware components and their interconnections.

Examples:

How the control unit is designed (hardwired vs microprogrammed).

How cache is structured (L1, L2, L3).
