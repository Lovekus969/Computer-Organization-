Computer organization
Main article: Microarchitecture
Computer organization helps optimize performance-based products. For example, software engineers need to know the processing power of processors. They may need to optimize software in order to gain the most performance for the lowest price. This can require quite a detailed analysis of the computer's organization. For example, in an SD card, the designers might need to arrange the card so that the most data can be processed in the fastest possible way.


A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs, which enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.

# Computer Architecture vs Computer Organization

**Architecture** describes *what* the system does (ISA, registers, addressing modes)...  
**Organization** describes *how* it’s actually built and implemented...

- Architecture first → then organization  
- Architecture = blueprint, Organization = implementation  
- Microarchitecture is another term for organization...
