Catche Memory Cache Memory is:

A small but very fast memory located between the CPU and main memory (RAM).

It stores frequently accessed instructions and data so the CPU doesn’t have to fetch them repeatedly from the slower main memory.

Access speed of cache is close to CPU registers, much faster than RAM.

It is more expensive than main memory, which is why only a small amount is used.


ache Levels (L1, L2, L3):

L1 Cache
        
        Closest to the CPU core
        
        Smallest in size (usually 32KB–128KB)
        
        Fastest (almost as fast as CPU registers)
        
        Stores the most frequently used instructions/data

L2 Cache
        
        Larger (usually 256KB–1MB)
        
        Slightly slower than L1
        
        Acts as a backup for L1 cache

L3 Cache
        
        Much larger (can be 4MB–64MB)
        
        Slower compared to L1 & L2, but still faster than main memory (RAM)

Shared among multiple CPU cores
