Catche Memory Cache Memory is:

A small but very fast memory located between the CPU and main memory (RAM).

It stores frequently accessed instructions and data so the CPU doesnâ€™t have to fetch them repeatedly from the slower main memory.

Access speed of cache is close to CPU registers, much faster than RAM.

It is more expensive than main memory, which is why only a small amount is used.
